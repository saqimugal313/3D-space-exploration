🎮 Controls:

Click on any celestial body to see detailed facts and physics notes
Drag anywhere to pan around the solar system
Scroll or pinch to zoom in/out
Use the speed controls to slow down or speed up time (up to 16x!)
✨ Features included:

Animated orbits with proper relative speeds (Moon orbits Earth faster than Earth orbits Sun)
Educational overlays explaining orbital mechanics, Kepler's Laws, and gravity
Toggle orbit lines, labels, and distance measurements
Touch-friendly for mobile devices
